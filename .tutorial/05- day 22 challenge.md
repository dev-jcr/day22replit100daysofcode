# ðŸ‘‰ Day 22 Challenge

Copy and paste your code from Day 18. 

We are going to make a change to this project:

Make the number generator completely random between 1 and 1,000,000. Now, the game will always have the user guess a *random* number each time (now the user can't cheat...)


```
Totally Random One-Million-to-One

What is your guess?: 500000
Too low

What is your guess?: 750000
Too high

What is your guess?: 600000
Too low

What is your guess?: 650000
Correct!

It took you 4 guesses to get the number correct.
Click 'run' to try again with a different number.
```

- Remember to import your library first and do NOT add it in the loop.
- You can keep a lot of Day 18's code, but need to add the random library.
