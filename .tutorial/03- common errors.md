## Name Error

ðŸ‘‰ Why is this code showing the error of "name not defined?"

```python
import random

myNumber = randint(1, 100)
print(myNumber)
```

This error is because of the way libraries work. The names of functions and variables in libraries may be similar to the names I chose for my functions and variables. The way to access functions and variables in other libraries is to put `random.` in front of the library name.

Now the computer knows to "go in the `random` library, find `randint`, and give me a number between 1-100."
  
```python
import random

myNumber = random.randint(1, 100)
print(myNumber)
```

## Error with random numbers and loops

ðŸ‘‰ For this code, I want 10 random numbers between 1-100 printed out. Why is it printing the same number instead of ten *different* random numbers?

```python
import random

myNumber = random.randint(1, 100)
for i in range(10):
  print(myNumber)

```

The problem is when I am generating my random number, I am doing it *before* the loop. I am asking for one random number and then storing it in a variable. Then, I am saying to `print` out this random number 10 times. Nowhere in the loop am I asking for a new number *each* time. I need to rearrange the order of my code. 



```python
import random

for i in range(10):
  myNumber = random.randint(1, 100)
  print(myNumber)

```
Now, each time the loop resets, it will generate a new random number. Now I can generate 10 random numbers between 1-100.
